It is important to regularly analyse the performance of the team and to compare it with the expected outcomes and projections. It is important to adjust assumptions once experience deems them to be inaccurate. Furthermore, the selection model may be impacted by changes in regulation, and hence needs to be regularly updated. In addition, emerging talent should be considered in future years as it achieves a balance between cost and benefit. However, in earlier years it is important to perform at a high level as potential investors will use performance as an investment proxy. Projected Revenue Rarita\u2019s revenue can be divided into three core categories: Matchday revenue, Broadcasting revenue and Commercial revenue. Other sources of revenue include loaning Rarita\u2019s players to other nations and interest earnings. Since the value of the interest revenue is comparatively immaterial and the income from loaning Rarita\u2019s players is pegged to the inflation rate, we shift the focus of this implementation plan to the variable sources of revenue. Matchday revenue is minor relative to the remaining core sources, however, it is an important driver of broadcasting and commercial revenue. For example, individuals attending the game are more likely to purchase merchandise. In addition, with the rotating geographical location of games played, individuals that are unable to travel to the stadium are more inclined to purchase the broadcast. Hence, Matchday revenue is a leading variable and must be closely monitored to ensure any early signs of changes in profitability are managed. This can be optimised through location. Population density is the highest in West Rarita, but it also possesses the lowest GDP per capita. As the broadcast is a non-excludable good, it may be optimal to stage games in areas with higher GDP per capita and population density. Central Rarita may be the most optimal location as it provides a favourable balance of GDP per capita and population density. Commercial revenue is the second largest source of revenue behind broadcasting. This category is largely comprised of sponsorship and merchandising. Merchandise sales may be used as a leading variable in monitoring the size of the fan base, while sponsorship is a lag variable and represents a large percentage of income. Regular issuance of new merchandise may improve fan interaction, and joint initiatives with sponsors will encourage strong growth in this sector. Broadcasting revenue covers all media revenue earned and is the largest driver of total revenue for Rarita. Being a lead variable, changes in viewer numbers should be monitored closely. Rarita can pursue partnerships with new media platforms to boost revenue in this sector.

The regressor variables that indicated a player\u2019s relative strength were their league standing, tournament rank and minutes played divided by ninety (90s). The most significant predictors for each player position were identified via sequential replacement subset selection and the relative influence output of the boosting method. Significant Predictors for Each Player Position: Afterwards, a metric to evaluate each player\u2019s proficiency was formed from the sum of the standardised significant variables. The final team selected using our team selection method is found below with an average team metric of 14.51 and consisting of 30 players. By using a maximum of 19 predictors, this greatly reduced the number of variables for each player. Only the most relevant predictors were chosen to allow for a better picture of each player\u2019s skill and expertise. The final metric was comparable and allowed for an accurate depiction of a specific player's skill. To measure the success of the metric, the following plot demonstrates the relationship between the average metric and the ranking of the teams in the 2021 tournament. There is an approximate relationship indicated by the graph; the higher the rank, the higher the average metric (hence performance of the team) which is in line with our assumptions. To account for any modelling/inference errors and deviations from the actual, more conservative measures were put into place in the prediction of win probabilities. Win Probability Given that our team metric is correlated with team performance, we use the difference between team metrics to derive the probability of a certain team winning. The intuitive idea behind the method is that greater differences suggest higher probabilities of winning. The probability of winning against each team can be seen in the table below: We also make a set of (baseline) assumptions on the tournament structure and growth environment: The tournament involves group stages of eight groups, where two teams from each group emerge. The remaining 16 teams play normal tournament bracket style matches (up to four more games). The probability our team exits group stages in any given year is a static 40% (this is a conservative assumption to reflect the weak relation between win rate and team metric). This can be adjusted for sensitivity analysis. We reinvest all excess cash flows back into the team, and so we very conservatively assume a 0.5% growth rate over our competitors. This growth will be reflected by an annual increase in our team metric. This can also be adjusted for sensitivity analysis. We face four random opponents after group stages. Using the win rates against each team, and the set of assumptions, the probability of winning the tournament at least once in the next 10 years can be calculated. This is visualised in the graphs below with varying set of assumptions (grey line is the baseline). Under the baseline assumptions, the team has a 95% chance of winning a final in the next ten years . The chances of placing top 5 in the next 5 years is approximately 83%. This in turns suggests a sufficiently high chance to place top 10 in the next 5 years.","title":"Team Selection"},{"location":"team_selection/#team-selection","text":"","title":"Team Selection"},{"location":"team_selection/#team-construction","text":"The Raritan football team was constructed by performing unsupervised regression analysis on historical player data to determine the statistics that contributed the most to each player\u2019s competitiveness.
