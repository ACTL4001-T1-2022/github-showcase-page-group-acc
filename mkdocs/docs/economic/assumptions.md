# Significant Assumptions

*	The interest on the loan was assumed to accrue at the spot rate. This is unrealistic as interest on a business loan would be charged at a premium over the prevailing spot rate.   
*	Player salaries are assumed to grow with inflation; however, this is unrealistic as they would also increase with player experience and performance. 
*	The growth in GDP was modelled using the multiplier effect, it assumed that all additional income is consumed domestically. This may overestimate the impact of the team on Raritaâ€™s GDP. However, the GNI projection may provide a sound estimation of foreign consumption. 
*	In the stress test, it was assumed all other variables remained constant except the variables being tested. Since the components of the economy are linked, one change should not be isolated.
