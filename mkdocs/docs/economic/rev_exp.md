# Analysis of Revenue and Expenses

The revenues generated and expenses incurred were indexed to inflation and projected over the investment 
horizon. Due to the fixed nature of the matchday and commercial revenues, they were assumed to be the same 
as those from Rarita’s domestic leagues. However, since the games are broadcasted internationally, the 
broadcasting revenue was averaged across the 21 countries. Expenses for Rarita’s national team were assumed
to be the same as those from Rarita’s domestic leagues, due to their fixed nature. The tournament winnings 
were estimated at ∂38m, in line with the 2018 FIFA World Cup. The winnings in each year were indexed to inflation
and multiplied by the probability of winning, yielding the expected value of tournament winnings.

The difference between the total expenses incurred in 2021 and the initial budget was ∂1,064,486,624.
To ensure solvency, this amount was borrowed as a loan with an eleven-year maturity. Interest on the 
loan was assumed to accrue at the prevailing eleven-year spot rates, and the loan was amortised 
with annual payments.

In calculating the NPV, the total earnings for each year were discounted using the average of the
relevant spot rates. The NPV of this project was ∂5,380,735,569.79, which indicates that it is profitable.
