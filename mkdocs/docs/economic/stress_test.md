# Stress Testing

In this sensitivity analysis, the impact of inflation, doubloon/euro exchange rate and the spot rate projections were analysed. Exchange rates were found to be the most significant variable while the spot rate had little effect. The NPV ranged from €4.2b to €5.4b.

The plot below shows sensitivity of NPV from changes in spot rate and inflation assumptions.
