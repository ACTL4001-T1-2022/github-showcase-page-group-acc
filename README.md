# Implementation Plan
## Projected Revenue
Rarita’s revenue can be divided into three core categories: Matchday revenue, Broadcasting revenue and Commercial revenue. Other sources of revenue include loaning Rarita’s players to other nations and interest earnings. Since the value of the interest revenue is comparatively immaterial and the income from loaning Rarita’s players is pegged to the inflation rate, we shift the focus of this implementation plan to the variable sources of revenue.

Matchday revenue is minor relative to the remaining core sources, however, it is an important driver of broadcasting and commercial revenue. For example, individuals attending the game are more likely to purchase merchandise. In addition, with the rotating geographical location of games played, individuals that are unable to travel to the stadium are more inclined to purchase the broadcast. Hence, Matchday revenue is a leading variable and must be closely monitored to ensure any early signs of changes in profitability are managed. This can be optimised through location. Population density is the highest in West Rarita, but it also possesses the lowest GDP per capita. As the broadcast is a non-excludable good, it may be optimal to stage games in areas with higher GDP per capita and population density. Central Rarita may be the most optimal location as it provides a favourable balance of GDP per capita and population density.

Commercial revenue is the second largest source of revenue behind broadcasting. This category is largely comprised of sponsorship and merchandising. Merchandise sales may be used as a leading variable in monitoring the size of the fan base, while sponsorship is a lag variable and represents a large percentage of income. Regular issuance of new merchandise may improve fan interaction, and joint initiatives with sponsors will encourage strong growth in this sector. 

Broadcasting revenue covers all media revenue earned and is the largest driver of total revenue for Rarita. Being a lead variable, changes in viewer numbers should be monitored closely. Rarita can pursue partnerships with new media platforms to boost revenue in this sector. 



# Economic Impact 
## Impact on Rarita’s Economic Indices

The fiscal multiplier acts as a link between revenue and the economy. Each doubloon received by Rarita will be re-distributed in the economy at the marginal propensity to consume. The gross impact of a doubloon on the economy is the fiscal multiplier. In the first year of operation, Rarita is expected to contribute ∂6.2b to the GDP, a 2% increase. Using Okun’s law, this increase in GDP will lower domestic unemployment, increasing the quality of life of Rarita’s citizens. The total estimated discounted value of the increase in GDP as a result of the team is ∂76.6b. 

We performed a similar calculation on the GNI, resulting in a discounted increase of ∂37.8b. This suggests that income earned by Rarita’s population is largely flowing to foreign economies. This is an inevitable effect of globalisation, and in theory should maximise consumer surplus. To increase domestic income retention, Rarita should look to hire domestic workers and minimise procurement from foreign economies. 

## Stress Test

In this sensitivity analysis, the impact of inflation, doubloon/euro exchange rate and the spot rate projections were analysed. Exchange rates were found to be the most significant variable while the spot rate had little effect. The NPV ranged from €4.2b to €5.4b..

## Significant Economic Assumptions and Limitations

•	The interest on the loan was assumed to accrue at the spot rate. This is unrealistic as interest on a business loan would be charged at a premium over the prevailing spot rate.   
•	Player salaries are assumed to grow with inflation; however, this is unrealistic as they would also increase with player experience and performance. 
•	The growth in GDP was modelled using the multiplier effect, it assumed that all additional income is consumed domestically. This may overestimate the impact of the team on Rarita’s GDP. However, the GNI projection may provide a sound estimation of foreign consumption. 
•	In the stress test, it was assumed all other variables remained constant except the variables being tested. Since the components of the economy are linked, one change should not be isolated.
