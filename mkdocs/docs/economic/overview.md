# Overview

The football team’s economic impact was examined by projecting revenues and expenses and
evaluating its net present value (NPV), which was **∂5,380,735,569.79**. The impact on Rarita’s economy
was considered through indices such as gross domestic product (GDP) and gross national income (GNI),
and the effects on tourism and Rarita’s provinces are also examined. Lastly, the sensitivity of the NPV to
inflation, interest rates, and exchange rates was also evaluated to gain an understanding of the effects of
shocks against initial assumptions. Key assumptions are also outlined at the end of the section.
