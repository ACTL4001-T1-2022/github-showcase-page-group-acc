# Impact on Related Industries

Countries with championship winning teams experience an increase in tourist arrivals over the two years
following the event. Tourism contributed to 10.4% of global GDP in 2019. Applying this to Rarita results
in tourism amounting to ∂30 billion in 2020. Extrapolating data from past FIFA winners, Rarita can
expect an increase of 12.79% in tourists per capita over the two years following a tournament win. 
Furthermore, being a World Cup champion will enhance the awareness of “Rarita” as a brand due to the halo
effect, which refers to the cognitive bias in which individuals rely on only one factor to influence their 
perceptions. This would form a positive impression of Rarita, causing it to be perceived as an attractive
tourism destination.

Winning the championship would also affect Rarita’s provinces. West Rarita has the lowest GDP and
healthcare spending per capita, while having the highest population density, indicating a lower
socioeconomic area. Investing in local arenas would create jobs, increasing West Rarita’s GNI per capita.
Further, as people from lower socioeconomic groups are at greater risk of poor health, hosting
international games would draw more attention to sport in this province, encouraging healthier
lifestyles and increasing life expectancies. East Rarita has the highest household savings rates, GDP and
healthcare spending per capita, indicating a higher socioeconomic area. Since sports expenditure is
correlated with disposable income, investing in recreational clubs would increase consumer spending,
thus stimulating the local economy. Further, merchandising outlets in this area would support the
perception of football as a “brand”.
