# Impact on Economic Indices

The fiscal multiplier acts as a link between revenue and the economy. Each doubloon received by Rarita will be re-distributed in the economy at the marginal propensity to consume. The gross impact of a doubloon on the economy is the fiscal multiplier. In the first year of operation, Rarita is expected to contribute ∂6.2b to the GDP, a 2% increase. Using Okun’s law, this increase in GDP will lower domestic unemployment, increasing the quality of life of Rarita’s citizens. The total estimated discounted value of the increase in GDP as a result of the team is ∂76.6b. 

We performed a similar calculation on the GNI, resulting in a discounted increase of ∂37.8b. This suggests that income earned by Rarita’s population is largely flowing to foreign economies. This is an inevitable effect of globalisation, and in theory should maximise consumer surplus. To increase domestic income retention, Rarita should look to hire domestic workers and minimise procurement from foreign economies.
