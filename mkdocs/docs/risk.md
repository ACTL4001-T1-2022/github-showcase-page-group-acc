# Risk Analysis

We use a Risk Categorisation and Definition Tool (RCD Tool) to specify key risks
that might impact the implementation plan. It also includes reduction/mitication strategies 
to employ is reduce their impact. We also use a risk map to portray the significance of each risk 
identified, as well as other considerations.

The risk map below categorises the above risks qualitatively by severity and frequency. It 
provides an indication of the impact of the risks:
